								Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, has been a renowned cultural, scientific and commercial centre for 
								many centuries. It was here, in 1880, that VU University Amsterdam first opened its doors to students. VU stands 
								for 'Vrije Universiteit' which means 'Free University'. Here, 'free' refers to freedom from state and church interference. 
								VU University Amsterdam was established in 1880 by orthodox protestants. Nowadays it aims to be inspiring, innovative and involved.
							</p>
							<p class="content_paragraph">
								Throughout the past century, the university has continued to expand. It now comprises twelve faculties 
								and has teaching facilities for 19,000 students.

								From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia" class="glink">Wikipedia</a>:
								<br />
								<br />
								Saint Lucia is a sovereign island country in the eastern Caribbean Sea on the boundary with the Atlantic Ocean. Part of the Lesser Antilles, it is located north/northeast of the island of Saint Vincent, northwest of Barbados and south of Martinique. It covers a land area of 617 km2 (238.23 sq mi) and has a population of 174,000 (2010). Its capital is Castries. Two Nobel laureates, Arthur Lewis, an economist, and Derek Walcott, a poet and playwright, have come from the island. It is the nation with the second most such honorees per capita after the Faroe Islands.
							</p>
							<p class="content_paragraph">
								One of the Windward Islands, it was named after Saint Lucy of Syracuse by the French, the first European colonizers. They signed a treaty with the native Carib people in 1660. England took control of the island from 1663 to 1667; in ensuing years, it was at war with France 14 times and rule of the island changed frequently (it was seven times each ruled by the French and British). In 1814, the British took definitive control of the island. Because it switched so often between British and French control, Saint Lucia was also known as the "Helen of the West Indies".
