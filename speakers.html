					Abstract
				</div>
				<p class="content_paragraph">
					Embedded devices are becoming ubiquitous. But did designers of embedded devices design for security? Of course they didn't! Not only do embedded devices leave us with new challenges for securing systems-- we have to deal with all the devices being connected to the Internet, that were originally expected to only live on private networks, such as infrastructure control systems. The end result is a world of peril, where death is even a possibility. In this talk, we'll look at why things are so bad, and explore areas for future work.
