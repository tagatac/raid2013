					Abstract
				</div>
				<p class="content_paragraph">
					Sophisticated adversaries are shifting from exploiting technical vulnerabilities to exploiting bad choices made by trusting insiders. We are also beginning to see malware that factors in a human actor who facilitates the intrusion. Security now rests precariously on the ability of people to make good choices – it’s the Achilles heel in any organization. Attackers will always eventually find ways to game new technical defences; we need to refocus on the human element of security and how defenses can adapt to users. With real examples, this talk takes a look at the depth of the problem, some innovative solutions, and opens a window into one of our industry’s greatest challenges.
