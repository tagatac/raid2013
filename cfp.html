	<p class="content_paragraph">
		For its <strong>15th</strong> anniversary, the <strong>RAID</strong> symposium changes its name from "Recent
		Advances in Intrusion Detection" to "<strong>Research in Attacks, Intrusions and
		Defenses</strong>". The new name reflects the broader scope of the conference that
		now aims at bringing together leading researchers and practitioners from
		academia, government, and industry to discuss novel research contributions
		related to any area of computer and information security.
	</p>
	<p class="content_paragraph">
		As in previous years, all topics related to intrusion detection and prevention 
		are within scope. In addition, topics of interest also include but are not 
		limited to:
		<ul class="list_paragraph">
			
			<li>Intrusion detection and prevention</li>
			<li>Malware prevention, detection, analysis, and containment</li>
			<li>Embedded System Security</li>

		Types of Submissions
	</div>
	<p class="content_paragraph">
		RAID 2012 invites two types of submissions:
		<ul class="list_paragraph">
			<li>
				<strong>Full papers</strong> presenting mature and novel research results.
				Papers accepted by the Program Committee will be presented at RAID 2012 
				and included in the Symposium's proceedings published by Springer in
				its Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Each paper must include
				an abstract and a list of keywords, and must not exceed 20 pages in
				total length, formatted in LNCS-style and including the
				bibliography and any appendices.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Poster abstracts</strong> describing works in progress, or innovative
				ideas not mature enough to be presented as a full paper.
				Posters are submitted for review in the form of an extended abstract 
				that has to be formatted in LNCS-style and not exceed 2 pages in length.
				In addition, posters titles should always start with the phrase 
				"Poster Abstract:". Accepted posters will appear in the proceedings and 
				will be presented at the symposium in a separate session.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p class="content_paragraph">
		All submissions (papers and poster abstracts) must be formatted
		according to the instructions provided by 
		<a href="http://www.springer.com/comp/lncs/Authors.html" class="glink">Springer</a>
		and then submitted
		electronically <a href="http://www.iseclab.org/RAID12/submit" class="glink">here</a>.
		Papers must list all authors and their affiliations; RAID does not
		require anonymized submissions. For accepted papers, at least one of
		the authors must attend the conference to present the paper. 
		Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that has
		already been published elsewhere or is submitted in parallel to a
		journal or to any other conference or workshop with proceedings.
		Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues,
		submission of previously published work, and plagiarism constitute
		dishonesty or fraud. RAID, like other scientific and technical
		conferences and journals, prohibits these practices and may, on the
		recommendation of the program chair, take action against authors who
		have committed them.
		Further questions on the submission process may be sent to the program
		chairs.
