				<!-- TYPES OF SUBMISSIONS -->
				<div class="longbar thinaddition">
					Types of Submissions
				</div>
				<p class="content_paragraph">
					RAID 2013 invites two types of submissions:
				</p>
				<ul class="list_paragraph">
					<li>
						<strong>Full papers</strong> papers presenting mature and novel research results.  Papers accepted by the Program Committee will be presented at RAID 2013 and included in the Symposium's proceedings published by Springer in its Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Each paper must include an abstract and a list of keywords, and must not exceed 20 pages in total length, formatted in LNCS-style and including the bibliography and any appendices.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Poster abstracts</strong> describing works in progress, or innovative ideas not mature enough to be presented as a full paper. Posters are submitted for review in the form of an extended abstract that has to be formatted in LNCS-style and not exceed 2 pages in length. In addition, posters titles should always start with the phrase "Poster Abstract:". Accepted posters will appear in the proceedings and will be presented at the symposium in a separate session.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="content_paragraph">
                    All submissions (papers and poster abstracts) must be formatted according to the instructions provided by <a href="http://www.springer.com/comp/lncs/Authors.html" class="glink">Springer</a> and then submitted electronically here. Papers must list all authors and their affiliations;  RAID does not require anonymized submissions.  For accepted papers, at least one of the authors must attend the conference to present the paper.  Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that has already been published elsewhere or is submitted in parallel to a journal or to any other conference or workshop with proceedings. Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, and plagiarism constitute dishonesty or fraud. RAID, like other scientific and technical conferences and journals, prohibits these practices and may, on the recommendation of the program chair, take action against authors who have committed them. Further questions on the submission process may be sent to the program chairs at <a href="mailto:RAID2013-PC-Chairs@lists.cs.columbia.edu" class="glink">RAID2013&#8209;PC&#8209;Chairs@lists.cs.columbia.edu</a>.
